== Creating single-AG filesystem ==
== Trying to repair it (should fail) ==
Phase 1 - find and verify superblock...
Only one AG detected - cannot validate filesystem geometry.
Use the -o force_geometry option to proceed.
== Trying to repair it with -o force_geometry ==
Phase 1 - find and verify superblock...
Phase 2 - using <TYPEOF> log
        - zero log...
        - scan filesystem freespace and inode maps...
        - found root inode chunk
Phase 3 - for each AG...
        - scan and clear agi unlinked lists...
        - process known inodes and perform inode discovery...
        - process newly discovered inodes...
Phase 4 - check for duplicate blocks...
        - setting up duplicate extent list...
        - check for inodes claiming duplicate blocks...
Phase 5 - rebuild AG headers and trees...
        - reset superblock...
Phase 6 - check inode connectivity...
        - resetting contents of realtime bitmap and summary inodes
        - traversing filesystem ...
        - traversal finished ...
        - moving disconnected inodes to lost+found ...
Phase 7 - verify and correct link counts...
