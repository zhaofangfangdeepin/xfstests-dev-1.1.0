Quick guide to auto-qa                                      dxm 04/10/2000
______________________                                      ______________


	- pick/create a user to run auto-qa and check they 
          can use ptools to check out of the tree
	- add your host to xfstests/common.config and check this file in
          OR create a local.config file in your xfstests directory
	- make a directory "$HOME/qa"
	- make a kernel workarea "$HOME/qa/2.4.x-xfs" for 2.4.x-xfs
	  and a commands workarea "$HOME/qa/xfs-cmds" for xfs-cmds
		(easiest to copy them from elsewhere)
	- copy an appropriate .config file to
 		$HOME/qa/$HOSTNAME.config
	- You'll need a hacked version of 'su' in $HOME/qa that
                lets your user su to root/root without a password
                (if you want to run from cron, it mustn't require
                /dev/tty). Warning - this is a massive security
                hole.
	- chown root.root $HOME/qa/su
	- chmod 6755 $HOME/qa/su
	- add the soon to be kernel to /etc/lilo.conf

		image=/boot/vmlinuz-xfs-qa
        		label=linux-xfs-qa
        		append = "console=ttyS0,38400n8"
		
	- $HOME/qa/auto-qa init

At this point, the script should update the workarea, clean it,
rebuild it, install it and reboot.

Then run

	- $HOME/qa/auto-qa restarted

And the tests should happen... and all pass, of course.

To get it going automagically:

	- add some lines to the appropriate user's crontab:

		0 4 * * *       $HOME/qa/auto-qa cron-init
		30 4 * * *      $HOME/qa/auto-qa cron-restarted

Notes:
	- if MODULAR=1 in auto-qa the XFS filesystem is expected to
                be a module; if MODULAR=0 it should be built into
                the kernel.
	- the test device is cleaned at the start of the QA run
		(to stop nightly QA being stuffed up if someone
		leaves the device inconsistant etc)
	- I'm using a hacked su because PCP sudo won't set the
		gid properly, and normal linux su won't run
		without a tty even if PAM is switched off.
	- The QA is restarted after reboot by a second cron entry
		to avoid the test being able to get itself into
		some stupid loop and so that it's always started
		by the appropriate user. You might have to make
		the second cron run later if your build takes ages.
	- Point the email addresses somewhere appropriate
	- When run in "cron-init" or "init" states, the script
		will p_tupdate itself and restart. If you start
		with an empty source tree, you'll need to check
		out the xfstests/tools/auto-qa script before it'll
		work (duh).

good luck.
