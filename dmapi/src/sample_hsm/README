The files in this directory comprise a simple HSM example that uses 
the DMAPI. These files are distributed in the hope that they will be
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  These programs
have been tested on an SGI platform (as of April 1995) and found
to be suitably functional; however, there is no guarantee that they
do, in fact, provide the functationality that is advertised. This
is a long winded way of saying they probably have bugs; if you 
find 'em, fix 'em. 

Okay, now that we have the disclaimers out of the way, here are the details.

	migfind
	=======
This will find all files of a specified size, and print out the handles.
It is normally used like this:
	migfind -s 800k /migfs >& cand_file

This example will find all files greater than 800K in the /migfs filesystem,
and put the handles (converted to ascii) in the file 'cand_file'. The output
consists of three fields per line:
	handle length		filehandle		file size in bytes

	migout
	======
migout reads a list of handles as created by migfind, and migrates
the files data. The data is stored in files that are located in 
another directory. The usage is
	migout /dmapi_fs/stagedir < cand_file

This will all the files specified by handle in 'cand_file', and
put their data in files located under the directory /dmapi_fs/stagedir'.
The staging directory must be on a filesystem that supports
the dmapi; the reason for this is to allow for a simplification
in the code that stores the location of the data as a DM attribute
(file handles are easier than path names).

	migin
	=====
This daemon waits for DMAPI events and dispatches worker bees
to actually stage the data in. The usage is:
	migin -l dmapi_log /migfs
migin will fork/exec a 'wbee' to either bring the data back from
the staging directory, or to invalidate the file.


Other programs:
There are a couple of other programs in this directory. 

	mrmean
	======
Simplist cleanup/debugging tool that will print information about
the active sessions. If desired, it can also respond to outstanding
events and destroy sessions that may have been left around from
a process exiting unexpectedly.

	mls
	===
Simple ls type program to display information about a file, such
as the managed region info, allocation info, event lists, and
file handle.
